# lfm

Terminal file manager heavily inspired by [LF](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf), written in C and using [notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses) and 
luajit. 
If you like LF but want more flexibility in the configuration and extensibility, this might be for you.

**Note: This is WIP. Nothing in the API is to be considered stable. Use at your own risk.**
